## Shared understanding on the Bank with Example Mapping
Please take some time to read about [Example Mapping](https://xtrem-tdd.netlify.app/Flavours/example-mapping).

From the previous step, we have discovered:
- missing invariants / business rules in our domain
- a misalignment on the Bank comprehension with our domain experts

We asked our business experts to be more explicit on the features provided by a Bank.

They worked on it and detailed some `User Stories` and defined some concepts to add to our `Ubiquitous Language`.

- **Story 1: Define Pivot Currency**
```text
As a Foreign Exchange Expert
I want to be able to define a Pivot Currency
So that I can express exchange rates based on it
```
- **Story 2: Add an exchange rate**
```text
As a Foreign Exchange Expert
I want to add/update exchange rates by specifying: a multiplier rate and a currency
So they can be used to evaluate client portfolios
```
- **Story 3: Convert a Money**
```text
As a Bank Consumer
I want to convert a given amount in currency into another currency
So it can be used to evaluate client portfolios
```
- **Ubiquitous Language**
  - **Pivot Currency**: The pivot currency is the currency via which the other currency values are calculated.

### Let's do it
- Run an `Example Mapping` workshop using the `User Stories` defined above as an input.
- Start by an individual time in which everyone can write his/her questions
  - Try to answer those questions based on your current understanding
- Extract business rules from your discussions
- For each business rule, identify at least 1 `key example`

Here are some resources to start with:
